Julia Cary and her kitten

--------------------

This project is relatively short, and as a consequence fairly quick and easy to
read.

I read the HTML version. It was an easy read, the formatting was consistent and
well-done.

Images: they are well done, clear, no issues with resolution or coloration.
They blended into the book well in my case (white background).

I have no negative feedback or corrective suggestions. I didn't spot any typos
or other problems.
